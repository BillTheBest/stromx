stromx
An open source solution for industrial vision. Visually solve vision problems and deploy the solution on a robust runtime.


Boxes:
 - Studio
   Stromx-studio is a visual editor to design and edit solutions for problems in industrial vision. It allows to construct complex data processing networks (="streams") by drag and drop. The effect of parameter changes can be observed in real-time while the network is executing in the studio.

 - Library
   Stromx streams can be executed outside stromx-studio in a runtime provided by the stromx library. It provides an API to safely start and stop the execution  of streams and to change the parameters of a running stream. The library licensed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license which essentially allows to use it in closed source products without restrictions.


 - Operators
   Implement custom operators and data types using the stromx API. Your own operators can then be assembled and configured in stromx-studio and deployed in any stromx stream. Use custom operators to easily integrate custom vision algorithms, access special hardware (industrial cameras, PLC,...) or communicate with database systems.
