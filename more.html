            <h1>The stromx story</h1>

	    <p>Imagine a well established manufacturer of totis. A toti is consists of many toti parts which are assembled automatically by very sophisticated robots. When one of the toti parts shows a special defect these robots become seriously confused and long production delays are the result. So the company decides to install a vision system which inspect critical toti part and rejects it if it shows the critical defect.</p>

	    <p>So the toti manufacturer approaches your company with this problem. Because there are many other producers of totis who most probably have the same problem you sense a good opportunity to sell a lot vision system. You ensure the manufacturer to develop a solution for their problem if they provide you with all information about the critical step in the production of totis.</p>

	    <p>You send some experienced developers to the production plant and they return with a batch of images of toti parts with and without defects. Full of curiosity you start throwing algorithms at the images to find out whether your dream of selling thousands of toti inspection machines will come to a sudden stop after a couple of experiments. Luckily, after a few days work you invent an algorithm which perfectly solves your problem. The images must undergo some pre-processing before the can passed to your algorithm but the code for these steps can easily found in well-known image processing libraries. Relieved that you are ready to earn a fortune with the toti business after just a couple of days work you start the construction of the inspection device.</p>

	    <p>Since the hardware components such as camera and illumation devices have already been selected during the acquisition of the test images the main focus is on the software which controls the camera, analyzes the images and communicates the inspection result. At that stage you remember that some ago you read this article about a software package called stromx which promised to provide an efficient infrastructure for such a solution. You soon realize that stromx provides all the image processing operations for the pre-processing steps which are necessary before you algorithm can be executed.</p>

	    <p>Implement the algorithm and solve the vision problem</p>
	    <p>Learn about stromx</p>
	    <p>Wrap algorithm and camera as stromx operators</p>
	    <p>Design stream in stromx-studio, adapt parameters, observer results</p>
	    <p>Change the stream topology</p>
	    <p>Introduce multi-threading (pipelining)</p>
	    <p>Add SQL and PLC operators</p>
	    <p>Implement a GUI</p>
